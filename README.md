This Progressive Web App uses the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and lets you find movies.
The searches come back packed with posters, release dates and a random popularity rating. Clicking on any of the posters brings you list of suggested movies based on the movie your clicked.
